    "# Error correction with cat qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "A central obstacle to building useful quantum computers is the prevalence of hardware-level noise, which corrupts quantum information long before meaningful computations can be completed. Quantum error correction addresses this challenge by encoding a single logical qubit across many noisy physical qubits, allowing errors to be detected and corrected without destroying the encoded information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dissipative cat qubits encode one logical qubit in the phase space of a quantum harmonic oscillator, also known as a bosonic mode. As the average photon number increases, the phase-flip error rate of a cat qubit can be suppressed exponentially, while the bit-flip error rate grows only linearly [[REF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11729)]. This asymmetry enables access to regimes of strong noise bias, where phase-flip errors can, in principle, be made arbitrarily rare, leaving bit-flip errors as the dominant remaining failure mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This noise bias can be exploited by concatenating cat qubits with higher-level quantum error-correcting codes that are optimized to suppress bit-flip errors. The result is a substantial reduction in the number of physical resources required to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, compared to architectures based on unbiased qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will explore how cat qubits enable significant reductions in hardware overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computing. You will also investigate novel error-correcting codes that are particularly well suited for concatenation with cat qubits, further reducing complexity and resource requirements.\n",

While the surface code is designed to protect against general, symmetric noise, the cat-repetition code is optimized for a strongly biased error channel in which phase flips are exponentially suppressed and bit flips dominate. By comparing these two architectures under their respective noise models, we can directly evaluate the advantages of exploiting hardware bias. We will focus on resource efficiency, logical error rates, and scaling with system size to highlight when and why a bias-tailored code can outperform a more general-purpose quantum error correcting code.\n",

    "Classical error correcting codes provide a natural and powerful pathway to constructing quantum codes by directly translating classical parity checks into quantum stabilizer measurements. In particular, any linear classical code can be mapped to a quantum code that detects and corrects **bit flip (X) errors** by promoting each classical parity check into a multi-qubit ( Z )-type stabilizer. In this construction, classical codewords become logical quantum states, and the syndrome extraction process is identical in spirit to classical decoding. This approach is especially well suited for hardware with **strong noise bias**, where one error channel dominates. In our case, biased cat qubits exponentially suppress phase flip errors, leaving bit flips as the primary failure mode. As a result, we can focus entirely on X-error correction, allowing us to use a much wider and more efficient family of classical codes than would be possible for fully general quantum noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final and core challenge is to choose any classical error correcting code (or family of codes), translate it into its quantum counterpart, and benchmark it against the repetition code that you already implemented. You will simulate the resulting quantum code in **Stim**, extract syndromes, perform decoding, and compare key performance metrics such as logical error rate versus number of physical qubits at a fixed physical error rate, encoding efficiency ( k/n ), the effective distance of the code and required hardware connectivity (i.e. what two-qubit gates are needed). This exploration will show how classical coding theory can be directly leveraged to design quantum codes that outperform simple repetition strategies when the noise is strongly biased.\n",
