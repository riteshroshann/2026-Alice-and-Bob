For instance, receiving `110` immediately signals that an error has occurred, since $110 \\notin \\mathcal{C}$. However, the error is only **correctable** by majority voting when at most one bit is flipped. If all three bits flip—transforming `000` into `111` or vice versa—the error becomes **undetectable**, leading to what is called a **logical error**.\n",

    "\n",
    "To formalize this idea, we introduce two related concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Hamming weight** $|\\bm{x}|$ of a binary vector $\\bm{x}$ is the number of entries equal to 1.\n",
    "- The **Hamming distance** between two binary vectors $\\bm{x}$ and $\\bm{y}$, denoted $D_H(\\bm{x}, \\bm{y})$, is the number of positions at which they differ:\n",

    "\n",

A high rate implies low redundancy and minimal overhead, while a large distance allows the correction of many errors. Ideally, one would like both quantities to be large. Unfortunately, these goals are fundamentally in tension: increasing one typically requires sacrificing the other.\n"
